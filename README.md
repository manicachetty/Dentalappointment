# **Build a contact center for booking and checking appointment with AWS Connect/Lex/Lambda**

This lab is provided as part of **[AWS Innovate AI/ML Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/events/aws-innovate/machine-learning/)**, click [here](https://github.com/phonghuule/aws-innovate-ai-ml) to explore the full list of hands-on labs.

ℹ️ You will run this lab in your own AWS account. Please follow directions at the end of the lab to remove resources to avoid future costs.

## **Overview**
In this lab, you will be building a contact center using Amazon Connect and integrating with Amazon Lex. Amazon Lex interprets dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) digits entered on a keypad. It matches the intent based on that input in the same way it matches the intent when you speak an utterance. This provides for greater flexibility for customers to interact with your contact center.

At the end of the lab, we will also explore [Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/), a feature of Amazon Connect, enables you to better understand the sentiment and trends of customer conversations to identify crucial company and product feedback. 

**Duration:** Approximately 1 hour

## **Architecture**

![](images/Architecture-Diagram.png)


## **This lab has the following sections:**
- [1. Launch AWS CloudFormation Stack](#1.-launch-cloudformation) 
- [2. Create Lex Chat Bot](#2.-lex-chat-bot) 
- [3. Create Amazon Connect Instance](#3.-create-amazon-connect-instance)
- [4. Amazon Connect Lex Integration](#4.-amazon-connect-lex-integration) 
- [5. Launch calls to test Amazon Connect features](#5.-launch-calls-to-test-amazon-connect-features)
- [6. Clean Up](#6.-clean-up)

## 1. Launch CloudFormation

You will use AWS CloudFormation to deploy an AWS Lambda function in your AWS account. It will be deployed in the **Sydney region**. Please ensure you follow directions at the end of the lab to delete the CloudFormation stack to remove resources.

Amazon Lex is currently available in the N. Virginia, Oregon, Sydney and Ireland regions. Additional regions will be added in future.

**1.1** Login to your AWS account.

**1.2** Right-click this link and open in a new browser tab: [Launch Stack into the Sydney Region with CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/stacks/new?stackName=LexFunction&templateURL=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/huu-shared/aimlinnovate/amazonconnect/connect-lex-integration.yaml)

The CloudFormation console will be displayed, with some information already entered.

**1.3** Click **Next** three times.

**1.4** At the bottom of the page, select "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources".

![Create stack](images/CreateStack.png)

**1.5** Click **Create stack**.

This will create an AWS Lambda function that you will use with Amazon Lex. There is no need to wait, you can continue with the next steps.

## 2. Lex Chat Bot
### 2.1 Create Chat Bot
You will now create a Lex Chat Bot that will be used to book appointments at a dental surgery. It will be capable of booking appointments for cleaning and whitening, and can also check and cancel appointments.

**2.1.1** In the **Services** menu, click **[Amazon Lex](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lex/home?region=ap-southeast-2#)**.

**2.1.3** Click **Get Started**.

You will be presented with a "Create your bot" page. A number of sample bots are provided, but you will create your own **custom bot**.

**2.1.4** Click **Custom bot**, then configure:

- **Bot name:** `BookAppointment`
- **Output voice:** _Salli_
- **Session timeout:** _5 minutes_
- **COPPA:** _No_

## 5. Launch calls to test Amazon Connect features
Use your phone to call the number you claimed, and follow the prompts. The Lex chatbot will be asissiting with booking appointment and checking appointment. 

### 5.1 Making calls to book and check appointment
- Dial the claimed nummber, press 1 and follow the prompt to make your dental appointment (cleaning/whitening). You should receive an SMS reminder.
- Dial again, press 2 to check the appointment. Amazon Connect recognises your phone number automatically, and look up DynamoDB to retrieve your existing bookings
- In these scenarios, the agent was not required. Instead, the job was done by the Lex Chatbot created by you and integrated to Amazon Connect Contact Flow.

### 5.2 Sentiment Analysis with Amazon Contact Lens
- To test this feature, we need to open **Contact Control Panel** to receive incoming call from your desktop. Click on the icon on the top right corner to log in and grant permissions such as Sound and Microphone

![](images/Contact_Control_Panels.png)

- Remember to set the staus as Available

![](images/ccp_available.png)

- Dial the claimed nummber, press 3 to talk to an agent. You would see an incoming call in **Contact Control Panel**. Accept the call, Let's assume that you are talking to an agent, and provide some feedbacks (both negative and positive) and end the call.

- Now, let's try to understand the sentiment of the call the agent has just received. 

- Go to **Contact Search** on the left navigation panel
![](images/contact_search.png)

- You will see the previous calls on the list with recording, timestamp, etc...
![](images/contact_search_list.png)

- Click on the **Contact ID** to analyze the call. In my case, i gave positive feedback at the beginning of the call and then negetive, so the sentiment trend analyzed is as follows:
![](images/ctr.png)

- See how easy sentiment analysis was done. Check out what else can be done with [Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/)
